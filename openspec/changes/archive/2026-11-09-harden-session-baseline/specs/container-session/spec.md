## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Optional session lifetime limit
`CODEX_CONTAINER_RUN_TIMEOUT` SHALL set the native engine lifetime of the session container in whole seconds. When it is unset, empty or `0`, no lifetime limit SHALL apply. Any other value that is not a positive decimal integer of at most ten digits SHALL fail with status 1 before engine queries. The limit SHALL be independent of the wrapper's interruption and cleanup deadlines.

#### Scenario: Lifetime disabled by default
- **WHEN** `CODEX_CONTAINER_RUN_TIMEOUT` is unset
- **THEN** the session container is created without a lifetime limit

#### Scenario: Lifetime expires
- **WHEN** `CODEX_CONTAINER_RUN_TIMEOUT=60` is set and the application is still running after 60 seconds
- **THEN** the engine stops the session container
- **AND** the wrapper prints a stderr notice that the session lifetime limit was reached
- **AND** the wrapper exits with the engine client's status and removes only its owned container

#### Scenario: Session ends before the limit
- **WHEN** the application exits before the limit
- **THEN** the wrapper propagates the application exit status unchanged and prints no lifetime notice

#### Scenario: Invalid lifetime value
- **WHEN** `CODEX_CONTAINER_RUN_TIMEOUT` is negative, fractional or non-numeric
- **THEN** the wrapper exits with status 1 and names the variable before any engine query or state creation
